# Professional Portfolio

## Description
Here I am creating a personal portfolio page to help kickstart my career as a developer. As I progress in this career, I will update my resume and this portfolio as a full stack developer and showcase my skills. This starts the beginning of the process of becoming the developer I strive to be and my progress will only excel from this point on. 

This site is intended for potential employers and other developers to take recognition of my skills as a web developer. The homepage of the site easy to read, well-organized, and aesthetically pleasing to view. Keep in mind that this is beginner level coding and it will improve over time as the portfolio becomes more diverse and more projects and code are added.

My website is to be used as motivation to fellow new come developers as well as inspiration and qualifications to potential employers to hire me for my services. 

This project is showing me that coding is more than possible and this career is both mind challenging and life-changing as it keeps me humble and focused in relation to my background and monetary situations. With this profession I am able to broadcast both intellect and creativity and create things that will hopefully help impact the world or motivate the next person who will change the world. The marathon continues...
